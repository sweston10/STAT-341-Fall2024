Write a paragraph on difference between variance and Standard Deviation?

Standard Deviation is the average amount of Varibility in your data set.
It tells you on average how far each score lies from mean. Variance is expressed
in much largeer units while standard deviation is expressed in the same unit.
Essentially, while variance gives a broad sense of spread, standard deviation provides a more intuitive measure by reflecting 
the average distance of each data point from the mean.

Explain the formula for each of these definition?

 Variance formula is In R, you calculate variance using the var() function. 
By default, var() calculates the sample variance. 

In R, you can use the sd() function to calculate the standard deviation. 
By default, sd() computes the sample standard deviation.
